# Sandbox

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository serves as a **sandbox environment** — a space for learning, experimenting with new technologies, libraries, programming concepts, and architectural patterns. There's no fixed structure or direction — just a place to explore and grow.

## 🗓️ Start Date

**Project started:** June 14, 2025

## 🧪 What's Inside

- Small test projects and proof-of-concepts (PoCs)
- Experiments with new programming language features (e.g., Java 21+)
- Frontend library testing (React, Angular, Framer Motion, etc.)
- Exercises in multithreading and asynchronous programming
- Sample integrations with databases, APIs, and Docker

## 📦 Technologies Used

Depending on the experiment, technologies may include:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- React / Angular
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- Docker / Docker Compose

## 🛠️ Repository Structure

Each folder represents a separate experiment or concept.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is **not production-ready**. Code may be incomplete, unoptimized, or messy — because the focus is on **learning and experimentation**, not perfection.
